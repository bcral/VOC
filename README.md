# Values On Chain (VOC)

### What is it?

Values-on-chain is a smart-contract based peer-to-peer nomination/reward system intended to be used to:
- Publicly praise co-workers for going above and beyond their job description
- Reward both parties involved in a peer-recognition transaction
- Provide an open and continuous ledger of previous achievements and rewards
- Reward users with something of value for their generocity and drive

### Why on-chain?

There's no better way to assure the records of performance are public, immutable, and value is given where necessary as a result.

### How does it work?

VOC will be a white-list only system for each organization.  This prevents reward token markets from getting out of the organization's control.

Each member of the organization will be given a wallet that is added to the whitelist.  One admin account will be in charge of managing this whitelist(which can very well be a multi-sig account).

At some regular interval, either automatically or manually, each member of the whitelist will be givent a set amount of new nomination tokens(NOMI).  These tokens alone are untransferrable and of no value.  The can only be used in one way, and that is to recognize someone for their above-and-beyond work.  After this, each party involved(both the recognizer and recognized) will receive reward tokens(RWRD) for their work/recognicion of someone else.  A text string will be stored with this transaction, explaining what it is this person did, and why they were recognized.

RWRD tokens can then be spent in any way the organization desires.
